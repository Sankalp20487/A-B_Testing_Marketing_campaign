# A/B Testing on Marketing Campaign Data

This project evaluates the effectiveness of a digital ad campaign using A/B testing on a dataset of 580,000+ users. The analysis investigates whether ad exposure increases conversions compared to Public Service Announcements (PSAs), and explores the impact of ad timing and volume.

---

## 🧪 Objective

To determine whether users exposed to **ads** convert at a significantly higher rate than those exposed to **PSAs**, and identify **when** and **how much ad exposure** maximizes conversion.

## 👥 Experiment Setup

| Group         | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Test Group    | Users shown **ads** (`test group = 'ad'`)    |
| Control Group | Users shown **PSAs** (`test group = 'psa'`)  |

---

## 📊 Metrics

### ✅ Primary Metric
- **Conversion Rate**: Proportion of users who completed a desired action (`converted = True`)

### 📈 Secondary Metrics
- `total ads`: Number of ads shown to a user
- `most ads day`: Day when most ads were seen
- `ads time`: Hour (in 12-hour format) of highest ad exposure

---

## 🧠 Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis
- **H₀**: Conversion rate is equal between ad and PSA groups  
- **H₁**: Conversion rate is different between ad and PSA groups

### Secondary Hypotheses
- Conversion varies by day/time of exposure  
- Users who convert see more ads

## 🔬 Statistical Methods

| Test                     | Purpose                                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Chi-Squared Test         | Categorical independence (e.g. ad vs PSA)   |
| Shapiro-Wilk Test        | Test for normality of ad exposure           |
| Levene’s Test            | Test for equal variance of `total ads`      |
| Mann–Whitney U Test      | Compare ad volume across converted groups   |

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Conversion Rate (Ad Group)**: 2.55%  
- **Conversion Rate (PSA Group)**: 1.79%  
- **🔼 Uplift**: **43% relative increase** in conversion rate for ad-exposed users

- 🗓️ **Best Day**: Highest conversion on **Mondays**
- ⏰ **Best Time**: Highest conversion around **4 PM**
- 📺 **Ad Volume**: Users who converted saw more ads (confirmed via Mann–Whitney U test)

---

## 💡 Actionable Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Ad Delivery on Mondays**, when conversions peak.
2. **Target peak hours (3–5 PM, 8 PM)** for higher conversion.
3. **Optimize ad frequency** — more exposure increases conversion, but should be tested further to avoid fatigue.
4. **Use PSAs as baseline** in future campaign ROI measurement.
5. **A/B test different creatives** now that format is validated.
